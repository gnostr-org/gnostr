Pure Rust implementation of SSH symmetric encryption including support for the
modern aes128-gcm@openssh.com/aes256-gcm@openssh.com and
chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com algorithms as well as legacy support for older
ciphers. Built on the pure Rust cryptography implementations maintained by the
RustCrypto organization.
